# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using the **Walmart Sales Dataset** (10k+ rows).  
It combines **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning and preprocessing with **SQL (PostgreSQL)** for advanced querying and analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw sales data using Python.
- Store structured data into relational databases (PostgreSQL).
- Write SQL queries to answer real-world business questions:
  1. Branch-wise sales performance
  2. Best and worst performing products
  3. Profit margin analysis
  4. Revenue trends (monthly, yearly)
  5. Customer behavior insights
  6. Identify peak sales periods
  7. Top categories and payment methods
  8. Revenue vs. cost analysis
  9. Branches with the highest revenue decrease (2022 vs 2023)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Pandas
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL for data storage and analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VSCode**: Development environment
